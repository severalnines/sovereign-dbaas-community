# Sovereign DBaaS Community
The Sovereign DBaaS (Database-as-a-Service) community is a growing group of individuals and organizations interested in a new approach to managing databases that prioritizes data sovereignty and control. This community advocates for solutions that address the limitations of traditional DBaaS models, which can often lead to vendor lock-in, data security concerns, and compliance challenges.
